### Formule in subnets

1. **Number of Subnets**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Number of Subnets = 2^(n - original prefix)

    **ðŸ“Œ Explanation:**
    - `n` = new CIDR (e.g., /26)  
    - `original prefix` = starting network CIDR (e.g., /24)  
    - You are **borrowing** bits from the host portion to create subnets.

    **âœ… Example:**  
    From /24 to /26 â†’ Borrowed bits = 26 - 24 = 2 â†’ Subnets = 2^2 = 4


2. **Usable Hosts per Subnet**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Usable Hosts = 2^(32 - n) - 2

    **ðŸ“Œ Explanation:**
    - `n` = CIDR  
    - `32 - n` = number of host bits

    **âœ… Example:**  
    For /26: 32 - 26 = 6 â†’ 2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62 hosts


3. **Total IPs per Subnet (including network + broadcast)**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Total IPs = 2^(32 - n)

    **âœ… Example:**  
    For /27: 2^(32 - 27) = 2^5 = 32 total IPs


4. **Subnet Increment (Block Size)**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Increment = 256 - value in subnet mask where subnetting happens

    **âœ… Example:**  
    /26 = 255.255.255.192 â†’ subnetting happens in 4th octet â†’ 256 - 192 = 64


5. **CIDR â†’ Subnet Mask**

    **ðŸ§¾ Steps:**
    - Write `n` ones followed by `32 - n` zeros in binary
    - Break into 4 octets, convert to decimal

    **âœ… Example:**  
    /26 â†’ Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000  
    â†’ Mask: 255.255.255.192


6. **Subnet Mask â†’ CIDR**

    **ðŸ§¾ Steps:**
    - Convert mask to binary  
    - Count the number of 1s = `n`

    **âœ… Example:**  
    255.255.255.224 â†’ 27 ones â†’ /27


7. **Wildcard Mask**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Wildcard Mask = 255.255.255.255 - Subnet Mask

    **âœ… Example:**  
    255.255.255.0 â†’ 0.0.0.255


8. **Network Address**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Network Address = IP Address AND Subnet Mask

    **âœ… Example:**  
    192.168.1.130 AND 255.255.255.192 â†’ Network: 192.168.1.128


9. **Broadcast Address**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    Broadcast = Network Address + 2^(32 - n) - 1

    **âœ… Example:**  
    Network: 192.168.1.128, /26 â†’ 2^6 = 64 IPs  
    â†’ Broadcast = 192.168.1.128 + 63 = 192.168.1.191


10. **Host Range**

    **ðŸ§¾ Formula:**  
    First Host = Network Address + 1  
    Last Host = Broadcast Address - 1

    **âœ… Example:**  
    Network: 192.168.1.128  
    Broadcast: 192.168.1.191  
    â†’ Host range: 192.168.1.129 â€“ 192.168.1.190

## RIP

```markdown
R1 -- R2 -- R3 -- R4 -- R5
 |                     |
  -------< >-----------
```

- Step 1 - **Router Initialization**
    - Routers boots and starts RIP
    - Router adds it connected network ( Routers ) to its router DB
    - For example, 
        - R1 has interfaces to:
            - 10.0.12.0/30 (to R2)
            -  10.0.15.0/30 (to R5)
        - R1â€™s routing table at this point:
            - 10.0.12.0/30 â€” directly connected
            - 10.0.15.0/30 â€” directly connected
- Step 2 - **RIP sends routing updates**
    - Distance vector
    - Each router sends its full routing table to directly connected neighbors
        - Every 30 seconds
        - UDP port 520
    - R1 sends to R2:
        - 10.0.12.0/30 â€” metric 0
        - 10.0.15.0/30 â€” metric 0
    - R2 sends to R1:
        - 10.0.23.0/30 â€” metric 1
        - 10.0.12.0/30 â€” metric 0

- Step 3 - **R1 Receives Update from R2**
    - R1 receives R2â€™s update
    - R1 adds R2â€™s networks to its routing table
        - 10.0.23.0/30 â€” metric 1
        - 10.0.12.0/30 â€” metric 0
    - R1 updates its routing table(Hop count)
        - 10.0.23.0/30 â€” metric 2 via R2
        - 10.0.12.0/30 â€” metric 1 `(R2â€“R3 link)`
- Step 4 - **Information Propagation**
    - R2 sends R3's networks to R1
    - R3's route (10.0.34.0/30) comes to R2
    - R2 updates its routing table
        - R3 advertised to R2: 10.0.34.0/30 â†’ 1 hop
        - R2 advertises to R1: 10.0.34.0/30 â†’ 2 hops
    - R1 adds 1 hop: 10.0.34.0/30 â†’ 3 hops via R2
        - R1 â†’ R2 â†’ R3 â†’ R4 = 3 hops to R4â€™s network

- Step 5 - **R1 Learns Multiple Paths**
    - R1 also hears from R5
    - R1 receives R5â€™s update
        - 10.0.45.0/30 (R4â€“R5) via R5 â†’ 2 hops
        - 10.0.34.0/30 (R3â€“R4) via R5 â†’ 3 hops
    - R1 has two paths to R4â€™s network
        - R1 â†’ R2 â†’ R3 â†’ R4 â†’ 3 hops
        - R1 â†’ R5 â†’ R4 â†’ 2 hops

- Step 6 - **Routing Table Convergence**

| Destination  | Next Hop | Metric (Hop Count) |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| 10.0.12.0/30 | Direct   | 0                  |
| 10.0.15.0/30 | Direct   | 0                  |
| 10.0.23.0/30 | R2       | 1                  |
| 10.0.34.0/30 | R2 or R5 | 2 or 2             |
| 10.0.45.0/30 | R5       | 1                  |

- Step 7 - **Periodic Updates**
    - Every 30 seconds, all routers continue sending their full routing table to neighbors.
    - RIP automatically adjusts when a link goes down `(after 180 seconds â†’ route is invalid)`. 

### Summary

| Step | Action                                   | Effect on R1                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | RIP starts, adds directly connected nets | Knows only its links                  |
| 2    | Receives updates from R2 and R5          | Learns about R3, R4 via neighbors     |
| 3    | Updates routing table with hop count     | Chooses shortest path to all routers  |
| 4    | Receives better paths                    | Replaces entries with lower hop count |
| 5    | Periodically sends and receives updates  | Maintains table continuously          |

## OSPF
- Link State Protocol
- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path

### OSPF Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Initialization**
   - OSPF starts on each router.
   - Each router identifies its directly connected interfaces and their states.

2. **Hello Packets**
    - Routers send Hello packets to discover neighbors.
    - Hello packets contain information about the router's ID, priority, and other parameters.
        ```
        R1 ---- Hello ----> R2
        R1 <--- Hello ---- R2  
        ```
3. **Establishing Adjacency**
    - Routers form adjacency with certain neighbors (like DR/BDR on multi-access networks).

    - Once adjacent, they start exchanging LSAs.

4. **LSA Exchange (Database Synchronization)**
    - Routers exchange Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) using Database Description (DBD) packets.

    - Routers use LS Request, LS Update, LS Ack to synchronize their Link-State Databases (LSDBs).

5. **LSA Types (Important for OSPF Operation)**

    | LSA Type | Description                                                                   |
    | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Type 1   | **Router LSA** â€“ Sent by each router within an area                           |
    | Type 2   | **Network LSA** â€“ Sent by DR in a broadcast network                           |
    | Type 3   | **Summary LSA** â€“ Sent by ABR to advertise routes between areas               |
    | Type 4   | **ASBR Summary LSA** â€“ Info about ASBR to other areas                         |
    | Type 5   | **External LSA** â€“ Routes to external networks (e.g., redistributed from BGP) |

6. **SPF Calculation (Shortest Path First)**
    - Each router builds a Link-State Database (LSDB).

    - It runs the Dijkstra's SPF algorithm on the LSDB to calculate the shortest path to all other routers/networks.
    
    ```
    SPF Tree (R1):
    - R1 â†’ R2 (cost 10)
    - R1 â†’ R3 (cost 20 via R2)
    ```

7. **Routing Table Formation**
    - After SPF calculation, each router creates its routing table based on the shortest paths found.
    
    ```
    Routing Table:
    Network 10.0.0.0/24 via R2, cost 10
    Network 192.168.1.0/24 via R3, cost 20
    ```

8. **Periodic and Triggered Updates**
- OSPF does not send periodic full updates.
- Only changes (like link down/up) trigger a new LSA.
- LSAs are flooded to all OSPF routers within the area.

### OSPF Summary Table

| Step | Description                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Routers initialize and assign OSPF areas |
| 2    | Discover neighbors via Hello packets     |
| 3    | Form adjacencies                         |
| 4    | Exchange LSAs (DB sync)                  |
| 5    | Build the LSDB with LSA types            |
| 6    | Run SPF algorithm to find best paths     |
| 7    | Install routes in the routing table      |
| 8    | React to topology changes with new LSAs  |

## STP ( Spanning Tree Protocol )

- Layer 2 protocol 
- Prevent loops in network 

### Building STP

Consider the below connection for STP:

```markdown
  SW1 â”€ SW2 â”€ SW3 â”€ SW4 â”€ SW5
   \_______________________/
```

#### Find the Root Bridge

- Each switch has a priority and a MAC address
- Select the lowest priority 
- If some has the same priority, choose the switch with lowest MAC as Root Bridge

| Switch | Priority | MAC Address       | Bridge ID (Priority.MAC) |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| SW1    | 32768    | 00:11:22:33:44:01 | 32768.00:11:22:33:44:01  |
| SW2    | 32768    | 00:11:22:33:44:02 | 32768.00:11:22:33:44:02  |
| SW3    | 32768    | 00:11:22:33:44:03 | 32768.00:11:22:33:44:03  |
| SW4    | 32768    | 00:11:22:33:44:04 | 32768.00:11:22:33:44:04  |
| SW5    | 32768    | 00:11:22:33:44:05 | 32768.00:11:22:33:44:05  |


#### Select the Root Port for Other Switchs

- Find the best path to Root Bridge
- assume all link are 1 Gbps = 4 cost

| Switch | Path to Root    | Total Cost | Root Port |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| SW2    | SW2 â†’ SW1       | 4          | SW2 â†’ SW1 |
| SW5    | SW5 â†’ SW1       | 4          | SW5 â†’ SW1 |
| SW3    | SW3 â†’ SW2 â†’ SW1 | 8          | SW3 â†’ SW2 |
| SW4    | SW4 â†’ SW5 â†’ SW1 | 8          | SW4 â†’ SW5 |


#### Designate Port to each Link

- Root as DP ( eg, in two links SW1â€“SW2 and SW1â€“SW5 )
- SW3â€“SW4	SW3 vs SW4? Tie â†’ use MAC
    - Both have equal cost (8)
    - Compare MACs
    - SW3 has lower MAC â†’ becomes DP

| Link    | DP Decision               |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| SW1â€“SW2 | SW1 is Root â†’ DP          |
| SW1â€“SW5 | SW1 is Root â†’ DP          |
| SW2â€“SW3 | SW2 has lower cost â†’ DP   |
| SW3â€“SW4 | SW3 vs SW4? Tie â†’ use MAC |
| SW4â€“SW5 | SW5 has lower cost â†’ DP   |


#### Identify Blocked Ports

- Any port that is not a Root Port (RP) or Designated Port (DP) must be Blocked.

#### Final Summary

| Link    | SW1 Port | SW2 Port | STP Status     |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- |
| SW1â€“SW2 | DP       | RP       | Active         |
| SW1â€“SW5 | DP       | RP       | Active         |
| SW2â€“SW3 | DP       | RP       | Active         |
| SW3â€“SW4 | DP       | Blocked  | Loop prevented |
| SW4â€“SW5 | RP       | DP       | Active         |
