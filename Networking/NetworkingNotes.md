# Networks
- manage people and devices

--- 

## contains :
- broadcast domain
- Collision domain

---

## Devices :
- Hub - does not break both domain
- Switch - breaks only collision domain
- Router - breaks both domain
- If there are n devices connected on a

| devices | Broadcast domain | Collision Domain |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Hub | 1 | 1 |
| Switch | 1 | n |
| Router | n | n |
